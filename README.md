# Utilising two API's to build a website for cats


## üê± Why cats? 

They make me happy and sometimes you need a small and silly project to boost your day


## üíª Which API's

I am using https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/ for the daily facts and https://github.com/ThatCopy/catAPI/wiki/Usage to get a random picgture of a cat.

### Why Typescript?

I decided to use TypeScript in thsi project as it forces me to write smarter and efficient code, as well for myself to learn how to set up an API call utilising types.
